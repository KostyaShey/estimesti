This project is a real-time scrum poker web app. Frontend is Vue.js (Vite). Backend will be Node.js/Express with WebSocket for session communication. No persistent storage; sessions close when host leaves.

Copilot should:
- Generate Vue components for session creation, joining, voting, and results display.
- Suggest backend endpoints and WebSocket events for session management and voting.
- Focus on real-time, ephemeral session logic.
- Avoid persistent database code.
